SkillSwap 
Trade skills, not money

SkillSwap is a peer-to-peer platform where people exchange services using skills instead of cash.  
A designer can create a logo for a student who helps them with French; a photographer can shoot a birthday in exchange for web design lessons.  
SkillSwap makes skill-bartering safe, structured, and fun.
